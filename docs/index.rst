Welcome to Attic
================
|project_name| is a deduplicating backup program written in Python.
The main goal of |project_name| is to provide an efficient and secure way
to backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes |project_name|
suitable for daily backups since only the changes are stored.


Easy to use
-----------
Initialize a new backup :ref:`repository <repository_def>` and create your
first backup :ref:`archive <archive_def>` in two lines::

    $ attic init /somewhere/my-repository.attic
    $ attic create /somewhere/my-repository.attic::Monday ~/Documents
    $ attic create --stats /somewhere/my-repository.attic::Tuesday ~/Documents
    Archive name: Tuesday
    Archive fingerprint: 387a5e3f9b0e792e91ce87134b0f4bfe17677d9248cb5337f3fbf3a8e157942a
