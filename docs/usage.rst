Usage
=====

|project_name| consists of a number of commands. Each command accepts
a number of arguments and options. The following sections will describe each
command in detail.

Quiet by default
----------------

Like most UNIX commands |project_name| is quiet by default but the ``-v`` or
``--verbose`` option can be used to get the program to output more status
messages as it is processing.

.. include:: usage/init.rst.inc

This command initializes an empty :ref:`repository <repository_def>`.
A repository is a filesystem directory
containing the deduplicated data from zero or more archives.
Encryption is enabled at repository initialization time.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    # Local backup repository
    $ attic init /data/mybackuprepo.attic

    # Remote backup repository
    $ attic init user@hostname:mybackuprepo.attic

    # Encrypted remote backup repository
    $ attic init --encryption=passphrase user@hostname:mybackuprepo.attic


.. include:: usage/create.rst.inc

This command creates a backup archive containing all files found while
recursively traversing all paths specified. The archive will consume almost
no disk space for files or parts of files that have already been stored in
other archives.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    # Backup ~/Documents into an archive named "my-documents"
    $ attic create /data/myrepo.attic::my-documents ~/Documents

    # Backup ~/Documents and ~/src but exclude pyc files
    $ attic create /data/myrepo.attic::my-files   \
        ~/Documents                               \
        ~/src                                     \
        --exclude '*.pyc'

    # Backup the root filesystem into an archive named "root-YYYY-MM-DD"
    NAME="root-`date +%Y-%m-%d`"
    $ attic create /data/myrepo.attic::$NAME / --do-not-cross-mountpoints


.. include:: usage/extract.rst.inc

This command extracts the contents of an archive. By default the entire
archive is extracted but a subset of files and directories can be selected
by passing a list of ``PATHs`` as arguments. The file selection can further
be restricted by using the ``--exclude`` option.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    # Extract entire archive
    $ attic extract /data/myrepo::my-files

    # Extract entire archive and list files while processing
    $ attic extract -v /data/myrepo::my-files

    # Extract the "src" directory
    $ attic extract /data/myrepo::my-files home/USERNAME/src

    # Extract the "src" directory but exclude object files
    $ attic extract /data/myrepo::my-files home/USERNAME/src --exclude '*.o'


.. include:: usage/verify.rst.inc

This command is similar to :ref:`attic_extract` but instead of writing any
files to disk the command just verifies that all files are extractable and
not corrupt. |project_name| will not compare the the archived files with the
files on disk.


.. include:: usage/delete.rst.inc

This command deletes an archive from the repository. Any disk space not
shared with any other existing archive is also reclaimed.


.. include:: usage/list.rst.inc

This command lists the contents of a repository or an archive.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    $ attic list /data/myrepo
    my-files            Thu Aug  1 23:33:22 2013
    my-documents        Thu Aug  1 23:35:43 2013
    root-2013-08-01     Thu Aug  1 23:43:55 2013
    root-2013-08-02     Fri Aug  2 15:18:17 2013
    ...

    $ attic list /data/myrepo::root-2013-08-02
    drwxr-xr-x root   root          0 Jun 05 12:06 .
    lrwxrwxrwx root   root          0 May 31 20:40 bin -> usr/bin
    drwxr-xr-x root   root          0 Aug 01 22:08 etc
    drwxr-xr-x root   root          0 Jul 15 22:07 etc/ImageMagick-6
    -rw-r--r-- root   root       1383 May 22 22:25 etc/ImageMagick-6/colors.xml
    ...


.. include:: usage/prune.rst.inc

The ``prune`` command prunes a repository by deleting archives not matching
any of the specified retention options. This command is normally
used by automated backup scripts wanting to keep a certain number of historic
backups. 

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    # Keep 7 end of day and 4 additional end of week archives
    $ attic prune /data/myrepo --daily=7 --weekly=4

    # Same as above but only apply to archive names starting with "foo"
    $ attic prune /data/myrepo --daily=7 --weekly=4 --prefix=foo

    # Keep 7 end of day, 4 additional end of week archives, and an
    # end of month archive for every month:
    $ attic prune /data/myrepo --daily=7 --weekly=4 --monthly=-1


.. include:: usage/info.rst.inc

This command displays some detailed information about the specified archive.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    $ attic info /data/myrepo::root-2013-08-02
    Name: root-2013-08-02
    Fingerprint: bc3902e2c79b6d25f5d769b335c5c49331e6537f324d8d3badcb9a0917536dbb
    Hostname: myhostname
    Username: root
    Time: Fri Aug  2 15:18:17 2013
    Command line: /usr/bin/attic create --stats /data/myrepo::root-2013-08-02 / --do-not-cross-mountpoints
    Number of files: 147429
    Original size: 5344169493 (4.98 GB)
    Compressed size: 1748189642 (1.63 GB)
    Unique data: 64805454 (61.80 MB)


.. include:: usage/mount.rst.inc

This command mounts an archive as a FUSE filesystem. This can be useful for
browsing an archive or restoring individual files. Unless the ``--foreground``
option is given the command will run in the background until the filesystem
is ``umounted``.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    $ attic mount /data/myrepo::root-2013-08-02 /tmp/mymountpoint
    $ ls /tmp/mymountpoint
    bin  boot  etc  lib  lib64  mnt  opt  root  sbin  srv  usr  var
    $ fusermount -u /tmp/mymountpoint


.. include:: usage/change-passphrase.rst.inc

The key files used for repository encryption are optionally passphrase
protected. This command can be used to change this passphrase.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
::

    # Create a key file protected repository
    $ attic init --key-file /tmp/encrypted-repo
    Initializing repository at "/tmp/encrypted-repo"
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again: 
    Key file "/home/USER/.attic/keys/tmp_encrypted_repo" created.
    Keep this file safe. Your data will be inaccessible without it.

    # Change key file passphrase
    $ attic change-passphrase /tmp/encrypted-repo
    Enter passphrase for key file /home/USER/.attic/keys/tmp_encrypted_repo: 
    New passphrase: 
    Enter same passphrase again: 
    Key file "/home/USER/.attic/keys/tmp_encrypted_repo" updated
